# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text, adhere to this brand persona.

## Brand Personality
* Professional but approachable
* Direct and efficient
* Tech-savvy but jargon-free
* Empathetic

## UX Copy Principles
* **Instant Clarity:** Provide clear, actionable feedback text for system states (e.g., "Overdue notices sent" or "Form saved").
* **Disclosure:** Use simple terminology for default views, and tuck away complex jargon gracefully in "Advanced Options".

## Grammar & Mechanics rules
* **Headings:** Use Title Case for main headings (H1, H2). Use sentence case for subheadings (H3+).
* **Punctuation:** Avoid exclamation points (!) in standard interface copy. Use periods for complete sentences.
* **Clarity:** Prefer active voice over passive voice. Keep sentences concise.

## Terminology Guide

| Do Not Use | Use Instead |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "In order to..." | "To..." |
| "Click here" | Be descriptive (e.g., "Save changes") |
